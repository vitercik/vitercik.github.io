I am an Assistant Professor at Stanford with a joint appointment
between the [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) department
and the [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) department.

My research interests include machine learning, algorithm design, discrete and combinatorial optimization,
and the interface between economics and computational. I am particularly excited about how machine learning can be used for discrete optimization and algorithmic reasoning.

Before joining Stanford, I was a [Miller](https://miller.berkeley.edu/)
fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by Michael Jordan and Jennifer Chayes.
I received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University,
where I was advised by Nina Balcan and Tuomas Sandholm.

My research has been recognized by a [Schmidt Sciences AI2050 Early Career Fellowship](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/schmidt-sciences-to-award-12-million-to-advance-research-on-beneficial-ai/) and an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2338226&HistoricalAwards=false).
My [thesis](https://vitercik.github.io/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf) won the
	[SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.sigecom.org/award-phd.html), the
	[CMU School of Computer Science Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/dissertation.html), and the
		[Honorable Mention Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://www.ifaamas.org/award-victorlesser.html).

I pronounce my last name [VIH-ter-sik](https://vitercik.github.io/assets/audio/vitercik.mp3).
