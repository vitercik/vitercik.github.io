I am an Assistant Professor at Stanford with a joint appointment
between the [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) department
and the [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) department.

I am particularly excited about how machine learning can be used for discrete
optimization and algorithmic reasoning.
Here is a [course](https://vitercik.github.io/ml4do) that I have taught on the subject.

Before joining Stanford, I was a [Miller](https://miller.berkeley.edu/)
fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by Michael Jordan and Jennifer Chayes.
I received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University,
where I was advised by Nina Balcan and Tuomas Sandholm.

My research has been recognized by an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2338226&HistoricalAwards=false).
My [thesis](downloads/thesis.pdf) won the
	[SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.sigecom.org/award-phd.html), the
	[CMU School of Computer Science Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/dissertation.html), and the
		[Honorable Mention Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://www.ifaamas.org/award-victorlesser.html).

I pronounce my last name [VIH-ter-sik](vitercik.mp3).
